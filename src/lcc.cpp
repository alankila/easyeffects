 * right ear and vice versa. By constructing delayed copy of the sound of the
 * channel for the contralateral channel, we can digitally cancel bulk
 * of the sound.
 *
 * We also need to enhance the center channel some because it is highly
 * correlated in low frequencies, and we are likely to reduce its level
 * by sending the canceled copies out.
 *

 *
 * A_out = A_in - decay_db * delayed_B_out;
 *
 * In addition to this, center channel is reinforced
 * outside the delay line
